    General Improvements:

            Needs to account for a possible camera, so that the dialogue window can appear in the game world or just as part of the GUI.
Resources:
    ☐ Allow custom definition of when a file needs to be reprocessed. This is necessary to allow types that just collect other files for processing (such as `.yarnproject` files).

Graph:
